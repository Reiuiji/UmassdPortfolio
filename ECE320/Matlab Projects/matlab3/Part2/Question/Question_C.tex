(c). As a first start towards unscrambling the speech, work through graphically what the output of the system will be when the input is 

\begin{center}
$ x_c(t) = (\frac{\sin(2 \pi (1000) t)}{\pi t})^2 $. 
\end{center}

Compare your results with the scrambled speech spectrum in part (b) to make your best guess at what the missing values are in the diagram. State clearly any assumptions you make in this process. Hand in sketches of the spectrum you get for each step in the process with all important frequencies labeled clearly.
