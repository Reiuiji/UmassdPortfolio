(b). Using what you learned on Project 5.1, plot the magnitude spectrum $ |X(e^{j \omega}| $ for the scrambled data file you loaded from the web site. Youâ€™ll need to use the wavread command to read your file into Matlab. Which parts of the spectrum look like speech? Instead of labeling your plot in DT frequencies (radians), work out the correct x-axis to label it in Hz (or kHz).
