{\LARGE Output:}

explain how you could have predicted this time sample.

Since the sample frequency $\omega_s = 2\pi*(8192)$ the sample frequency is 8192 which means T = 1/8192. In order of the highest frequency for the sinusoidal $\Omega_{inst}(t)  =  \frac{ d}{d x} ( \Omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \beta t^2 ) $.
