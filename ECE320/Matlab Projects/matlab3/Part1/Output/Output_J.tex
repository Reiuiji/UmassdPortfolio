{\LARGE Output:}

Explain how you could have predicted the times at which the played signal has zero (or very low) frequency.

Upon Listening to the chirp sound, I noticed that it fluctuates the pitch 2.5 times in the entire sound. This means that it alternates a pi means 2 seconds. 

The patteren for the chirp went:

$[mid | start |0] -> [high |1] -> [mid |2] -> [low |3] -> [mid |4] -> [high |5] -> [mid |6] -> [low |7] -> [mid |8] -> [high |9] -> [mid | end |10] $

So therefore the lowest is at 3,7 seconds in the chirp
