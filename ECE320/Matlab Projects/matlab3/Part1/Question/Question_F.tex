(f). Now repeat Parts (a) and (c) - do not repeat Part (b) - for the sinusoidal frequencies $\Omega_0 = 2\pi(3500)$, $2\pi(4000)$, $2\pi(4500)$, $2\pi(5000)$, and $2\pi(5500)$ rad/sec. Also play each sample signal using sound. Does the pitch of the tone that you hear increase with each increase in the frequency $\Omega_0$? If not, can you explain this behavior?
