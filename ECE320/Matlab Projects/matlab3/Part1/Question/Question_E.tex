(e). Play each of the smapled signals created in Part(d) using sound(x,1/T). Does the pitch of the tone that you hear increase with increasing frequency $\Omega_0$? Note that, like plot, the function sound performs interpolation. In essence, your computer converts the discrete-time signal in MATLAB into a continuous-time signal using a digital-to-analog converter, and then plays this continous-time signal on its speaker.
