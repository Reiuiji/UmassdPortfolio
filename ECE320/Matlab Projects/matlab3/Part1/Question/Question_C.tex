(c). Use [X,f]=ctfts(x,T) to calculate the continuoues-time Fourier transform of the reconstructed signal $x_r(t)$. Plot the magnitude of X versus f. Is X nonzero at the proper frequency values? (Note that almost all the elements in X are nonzero, but most are small values due to numerical round-off errors.) Is the phase of X correct, assuming that the phase is equal to zero when X is nearly zero, I.E., nonzero only due to reound-off error.
