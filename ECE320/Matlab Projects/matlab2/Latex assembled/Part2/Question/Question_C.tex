use h and the modulation property to design a bandpass filter whose frequency response approximates an ideal bandpass filter with the following frequency response between $-\pi\ and\ \pi$:\\
\\
\[ H_{bpf}(e^{j \omega}) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    1 & \quad \text{$3\pi/10 \le |\omega| \le 7\pi/10$,} \\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise.}
  \end{array} \right.\]

store the real-values impulse response of your bandpass filter in h2. Generate an appropriately labelled plot demonstrating the magnitude of the frequency response of your filter approximates the ideal bandpass filter in Eq. (6.11). Also, plot h2 using atem. How are h and h2 related?\\
