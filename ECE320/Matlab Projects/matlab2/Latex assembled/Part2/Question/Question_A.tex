For the filter with impulse response h, compute the frequency response at 1024 evenly spaced samples in w using freqz and store these values in H. Plot the magnitude of H and confirm that it approximates the desired frequency response magnitude $ |H_{id}(e^{j\omega})|$. Also, plot the impulse response h using stem. Analytically calculate the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter specified by Eq(6.9). Is h similar in form to the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter?
