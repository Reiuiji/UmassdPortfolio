Use linearity and modulation property to design a bandstop filter from h whose frequency response approximates an ideal bandstop filter with the following frequency response between $-\pi\ and\ \pi$:\\
\[ H_{bsf}(e^{j \omega}) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    0 & \quad \text{$3\pi/10 \le |\omega| \le 7\pi/10$,} \\
    1 & \quad \text{otherwise.}
  \end{array} \right.\]

Store the real-values impulse response of your bandstop filter in h3. Generate an appropriately labelled plot demonstrating that the magnitude of the frequency response of your filter approximates the ideal bandstop filter above.
