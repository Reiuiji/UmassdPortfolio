Usage
=====

You can look through the work free but please respect the following rules:
* Please don't copy paste my work and say it your own(plagiarize)
* If you use code please keep in mind of citing the sources
* Fork and create your own or improve my work
* Overall learn and have fun

Notice
======
This is made public as of Friday April 21st, 2017.
I know this may be a little messy, and need house keeping. As semester's progress I forgot to post each change so I just ended up pushing at the end of semester after I recovered.
I intended for this to be used as an archive/portfolio of my work. If you have any questions or feedback just message me or submit an issue request.
