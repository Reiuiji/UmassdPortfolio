Say we have a class to represent a point in a 2-dimensional plane

What data should this class hold?
	This class should hold the value of the point, location(x,y),

What should the constructor look like?
	   "Point();
		Point(double X, double Y);"
	in the Point.h file

How would we write the mutator function(s)?
	   "void setPoint(double X, double Y);"


How would we write the accessor function(s)?
	   "double getPoint();"



//WCT code
Point.h
Point.cpp
